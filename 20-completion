## From the zsh man page:
# In the form `yes=num', where `yes' may be any of the true values (`yes',
# `true', `on' and `1'), menu completion will be turned on if there are at least
# num matches.
#
# In the form `select=num', menu selection will only be started if there are at
# least num matches.

#neither of the three doesn't go to top. and doesn't do highlighting
#zstyle ':completion:*:default' menu yes=0          # BAD: doesn't show ambiguity before picking the first, and no highlighting
#zstyle ':completion:*:default' menu select=0 yes=0 # BAD: doesn't show ambiguity before picking the first
zstyle ':completion:*:default' menu select=0
zstyle ':completion:*:default' compstate last_prompt=1

# I don't activate `interactive' or `search' but they seem worth looking at:
#
## From the zsh man page:
# Finally, it is possible to activate two special modes of menu selection. The
# word `interactive' in the value causes interactive mode to be entered
# immediately when menu selection is started; see the description of the
# zsh/complist module in zshmodules(1) for a description of interactive mode.
# Including the string `search' does the same for incremental search mode. To
# select backward incremental search, include the string `search-backward'.

## From the zsh man page:
# If the value is `0' (zero), the list is scrolled by half-screenfuls
zstyle ':completion:*:default' select-scroll 0
